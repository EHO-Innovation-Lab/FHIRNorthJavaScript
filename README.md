# DHDR Node.js Viewer
This viewer was made to demonstrate how a Node.js web application can interact with Innovation Lab's DHDR. Queries are made by submitting a health card number to its own controller. From there, a query is built and then sent to Innovation Lab's DHDR server. A bundle is then returned and displayed client side.
